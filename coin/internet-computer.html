                <p class="body-content mt-1 ml-1" style="font-size: 1.25rem;">The Internet Computer price soared by more than 30% since the beginning of the month & continues to flash extreme bullish signals 
                    The bulls appear to be well positioned and hence a significant upswing may lead the price to reach the milestone above $10
                    The ICP price is determined to rise high but the dropped development activity and the social dominance may hinder the rally
                    Internet Computer price has been largely bullish since the beginning of the month and can add up another 30% to their value. The token has been printing consecutive bullish candles without any major bearish interference. Moreover, the trend may remain bullish as the buying pressure continues to mount, which may assist the price rise toward the next milestone. In the meantime, the platform has launched ‘Liquid Bitcoin’ which offers faster and cheaper BTC transactions. 
                    
                    The decentralized platform recently launched a new token called ckBTC which is pegged 1:1 to Bitcoin. This token is a new version of BTC that is cost-effective and liquid for faster and cheaper transactions on the Internet Computer network without compromising security or decentralization. The token is created and destroyed by the network governed by a DAO, which offers layer 2 capabilities to Bitcoin. Therefore, with this significant step, the ICP network is believed to thrive, adding more value to its toke</p>
